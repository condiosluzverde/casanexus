CasaNexus is a consumer home appliance that is the family datacenter in-a-box that hangs on the wall in the utility area.  

One installs the appliance, connects the internet to one side, and the home network on the other.  Not only does the CasaNexus facilitate all the digital communication resources for the home, it also supports all the family digital devices via VPN-like behind-the-firewall ecosystem called Casita.

The CasaNexus team credo is individual freedom, pricacy and control.  As technology hardware and software improve, CasaNexus brings digital capabilities further to the edge, right into the home - and to all the family devices.

CasaNexus is a libre open source and open hardware ecosystem, focused on secure, private and distributed among the family first - and all other collaborations build from there.

There is no one single hardware device, nor any one software system that comprises CasaNexus - the appliance uses an open archtitecture back-plane like plug-and-play case where one can purchase specialized devices for various purposes.  For example, one could have a BitSeed device for family digital currencies or distributed data, a capable router like Turis Omnia, redundant power, RAID disk storage, and general purpose computing hardware/software that could run things like entertainment and communications (like video, music, written communications, photos, events, etc.)

There are many projects and products that are all headed this way, such as the ones cited above - the CasaNexus project puts them all together, builds community for empowering and supporting each other while we re-write and re-realize the internet to materialize all of the benefits of digital communications while leaving behind the centralized "fake-free" services that have somehow lead to advertising leading the way, and for each of us letting each other down by supporting the wholesale mis-use of our personal information - our thinking, our sharing, and our being.

In a distributed digital network world, each one pays their own way - some will lead with creating the products and many will follow when they see how sensible it is to own one's own digital information.
